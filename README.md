# 1.6 Control Structures

This repository contains resources for the [1.6 Control structures](https://conceptstocode.apolloacademy.au/100-programming-fundamentals/1.6-control-structures) module in the Stage 6 HSC Software Engineering textbook [Concepts to Code: Beginning Software Engineering](https://conceptstocode.apolloacademy.au/).

Students should download, complete, and organise these tasks in their own working repositories using the IDE of their choice (e.g. PyCharm, JupyterLab, WebStorm, Visual Studio, etc.)

## Structure
operations-manual/   # Authoritative guide to using sequence, selection, and repetition
training/            # Jupyter-based microlabs to practise control structures and pseudocode
simulation/          # A macrolab to apply selection and iteration in a realistic problem
clearance/           # Assessment-style exercises to test control flow understanding
mission/             # A programming challenge requiring combinations of control structures
debrief/             # Structured reflection on logic, problem-solving, and debugging

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the files you need. This can also be done directly from the textbook.
2. Work locally using your preferred IDE or notebook environment.
3. Save your progress in your own GitHub repository.
4. Refer to the **Operations Manual** as your primary guide for understanding sequence, selection, and repetition.
5. Use pseudocode and flowcharts to plan your logic before coding.
